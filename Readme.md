Scatter Plot: Gives an idea about the population density of countries. Example: a country in top left will be one with very high density and one on bottom right will be one with very low density.

Box Plot: Depicts population data of countries in consecutive years. Not much variation in the overall distribution in three consecutive years. 

Bar Plot: Comparison among area of countries. Clearly Russia stands out among the group.
